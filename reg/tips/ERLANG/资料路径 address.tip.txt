Installing and updating
Install Erlang R20 or later, if it isn’t already present on your system. On Windows systems, use a path with no spaces in it.
Install Eclipse. We target version starting with 4.9+.
If your network uses a proxy to connect to the internet, fill in the appropriate data in Window -> Preferences -> Install/Update -> Proxy settings
Install Erlide by going to Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install... -> Search for new features to install.
In the dialog, choose New remote site and enter Erlide as name and https://download.erlide.org/update as URL.
Select Erlang IDE and maybe the optional add-ins. Press Next, again Next, accept the license agreement and Finish. You may be asked to agree to install unsigned content, do so.
Restart. Go to Window -> Preferences -> Erlang -> Installed runtimes and add an entry (or several) for your Erlang installation(s) of choice. The required parameters are the name and the path to the top level directory (i.e. $ERL_TOP). Now restart again.
Done! You’re ready to start exploring.
