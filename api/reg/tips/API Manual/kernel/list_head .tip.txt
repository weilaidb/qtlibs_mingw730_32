☆ 简介
readahead - initiate file readahead into page cache

#define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <fcntl.h>

       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t offset, size_t count);

readahead() initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent
       reads from that file will be satisfied from the cache, and not
       block on disk I/O (assuming the readahead was initiated early
       enough and that other activity on the system did not in the
       meantime flush pages from the cache).

       The fd argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which
       is to be read.  The offset argument specifies the starting point
       from which data is to be read and count specifies the number of
       bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that
       offset is effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes
       are read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to
       (offset+count).  readahead() does not read beyond the end of the
       file.  The file offset of the open file description referred to
       by the file descriptor fd is left unchanged.
☆ 参数


☆ 返回值
On success, readahead() returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned,
       with errno set to indicate the error.

☆ 错误码
 EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for
              reading.

       EINVAL fd does not refer to a file type to which readahead() can
              be applied.


☆ 示例


☆ 限制说明
On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for this
       system call differs, for the reasons described in syscall(2).

☆ 安全说明
       readahead() attempts to schedule the reads in the background and
       return immediately.  However, it may block while it reads the
       filesystem metadata needed to locate the requested blocks.  This
       occurs frequently with ext[234] on large files using indirect
       blocks instead of extents, giving the appearance that the call
       blocks until the requested data has been read.
