透明进程间通信协议(Transparent Interprocess Communication)
Transparent Inter Process Communication Protocol

Abstract
This document specifies TIPC, a protocol specially designed for efficient communication within clusters of loosely coupled nodes.

TIPC provides two types of services to its applications:

An "all-in-one" L2 or L3 based message transport service:

Reliable datagram unicast, anycast and multicast.
Reliable connections with stream or message transport.
Location transparent service addressing.
Multi-binding of addresses.
Supervised node-to-node transport links with loss-free failover.
A service and topology tracking function:

Tracking nodes, processes, sockets, addresses and connections.
Subscription/event function for service/functional addresses.
Immediate feedback at service,topology or connectivity changes.
Automatic neighbor discovery.
