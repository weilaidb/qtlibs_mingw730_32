Frame check sequence (FCS) errors indicate that frames of data are being corrupted during transmission. FCS error count is the number of frames that were transmitted/received with a bad checksum (CRC value) in the Ethernet frame. These frames are dropped and not propagated onto other ports.

<BR><BR>Could be caused by many different things..<BR><BR>From the cisco website...<BR><BR>Many performance issues with NICs can be related to data link errors. Excessive errors usually indicate a problem. When operating at half-duplex setting, some data link errors such as Frame Check Sequence (FCS), alignment, runts, and collisions are normal. Generally, a one percent ratio of errors to total traffic is acceptable for half-duplex connections. If the ratio of errors to input packets is greater than two or three percent, performance degradation may be noticed. <BR><BR>In half-duplex environments, it is possible for both the switch and the connected device to sense the wire and transmit at exactly the same time and result in a collision. Collisions can cause runts, FCS, and alignment errors due to the frame not being completely copied to the wire which results in fragmented frames. <BR><BR>When operating at full-duplex, FCS, Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC), alignment errors, and runt counters should be minimal. If the link is operating at full-duplex, the collision counter is not active. If the FCS, CRC, alignment, or runt counters are incrementing, check for a duplex mismatch. Duplex mismatch is a situation where the switch is operating at full-duplex and the connected device is operating at half-duplex, or vice versa. The result of a duplex mismatch will be extremely slow performance, intermittent connectivity, and loss of connection. Other possible causes of data link errors at full-duplex are bad cables, faulty switch port, or NIC software/hardware issues. <BR><BR><BR>Zy
