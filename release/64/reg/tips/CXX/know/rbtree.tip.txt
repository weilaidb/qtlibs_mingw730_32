   16  * red-black trees properties:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rbtree
   17  *
   18  *  1) A node is either red or black
   19  *  2) The root is black
   20  *  3) All leaves (NULL) are black
   21  *  4) Both children of every red node are black
   22  *  5) Every simple path from root to leaves contains the same number
   23  *     of black nodes.
   24  *
   25  *  4 and 5 give the O(log n) guarantee, since 4 implies you cannot have two
   26  *  consecutive red nodes in a path and every red node is therefore followed by
   27  *  a black. So if B is the number of black nodes on every simple path (as per
   28  *  5), then the longest possible path due to 4 is 2B.
   29  *
   30  *  We shall indicate color with case, where black nodes are uppercase and red
   31  *  nodes will be lowercase. Unknown color nodes shall be drawn as red within
   32  *  parentheses and have some accompanying text comment.
