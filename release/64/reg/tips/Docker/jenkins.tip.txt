解锁 Jenkins
为了确保管理员安全地安装 Jenkins，密码已写入到日志中（不知道在哪里？）该文件在服务器上：

/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

请从本地复制密码并粘贴到下面。

管理员密码


cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword



新手入门
Jenkins已就绪！
你已跳过创建admin用户的步骤。要登录请使用用户名：'admin' 及用于访问安装向导的管理员密码。
您已经跳过了 Jenkins URL的配置。

要配置 Jenkins URL的话，到“Jenkins管理”页面。
Jenkins安装已完成。

The following variables are available to shell scripts

CI
Statically set to the string "true" to indicate a "continuous integration" execution environment.
BUILD_NUMBER
The current build number, such as "153".
BUILD_ID
The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in 1.597+, but a YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss timestamp for older builds.
BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME
The display name of the current build, which is something like "#153" by default.
JOB_NAME
Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".
JOB_BASE_NAME
Short Name of the project of this build stripping off folder paths, such as "foo" for "bar/foo".
BUILD_TAG
String of "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}". All forward slashes ("/") in the JOB_NAME are replaced with dashes ("-"). Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.
EXECUTOR_NUMBER
The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) that’s carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.
NODE_NAME
Name of the agent if the build is on an agent, or "master" if run on master.
NODE_LABELS
Whitespace-separated list of labels that the node is assigned.
WORKSPACE
The absolute path of the directory assigned to the build as a workspace.
WORKSPACE_TMP
A temporary directory near the workspace that will not be browsable and will not interfere with SCM checkouts. May not initially exist, so be sure to create the directory as needed (e.g., mkdir -p on Linux). Not defined when the regular workspace is a drive root.
JENKINS_HOME
The absolute path of the directory assigned on the master node for Jenkins to store data.
JENKINS_URL
Full URL of Jenkins, like http://server:port/jenkins/ (note: only available if Jenkins URL set in system configuration).
BUILD_URL
Full URL of this build, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/15/ (Jenkins URL must be set).
JOB_URL
Full URL of this job, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/ (Jenkins URL must be set).
