LispWorks IDE
The LispWorks IDE provides a smooth and comfortable workflow, allowing you to incrementally write, test, and extend your software while it is running. It is included in LispWorks on all supported platforms. The LispWorks IDE is written using the CAPI portable GUI toolkit and therefore it runs natively on macOS, Windows®, GTK+ and Motif®.

Debugger
The Debugger tool offers an intuitive graphical view of the stack, allows modification of variables and offers all the restarts. You can jump directly from a stack frame to point reached within the function's definition in an Editor tool displaying the source code.

Listener
The Listener tool allows you to interact with the Lisp interpreter. You can easily transfer Lisp objects to other tools such as the Inspector, or invoke the graphical Debugger tool .

Editor
This is a powerful Lisp-aware code editor with built-in source location and syntax coloring. Commonly-used commands are accessible by menus and a wide range of commands is accessible either by Emacs keys or familiar platform-standard keys, all of which are customizable.

Inspector
The Inspector tool is a graphical interface for the Common Lisp function inspect. It is used for speedy exploration of Lisp objects - just double click on a slot to inspect the value in the slot - and can also modify the values. Further, the Inspector can be configured with new views on your own data structures.

The LispWorks IDE tools all work together smoothly. For example, a frequent operation is to transfer the inspected object to the Listener tool, achieved by the command Object > Listen.
