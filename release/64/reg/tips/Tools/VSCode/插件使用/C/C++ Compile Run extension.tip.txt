An extension running on Visual Studio Code to Compile, Run & Debug single c/c++ files easily

Extension

Features
Compile, Run & Debug C/C++ opened file directly from the command palette, by pressing 'f6', 'f7', 'f5', or by using status bar/menu icons.

Requirements
If you are on linux you must install gcc (see instructions)
If you are on window you must install tdm-gcc (see instructions)
If you are on mac os you must install clang/gcc (see instructions)
How to use
Make sure you have .c or .cpp file open. Press "F6", this will compile and run the file using default arguments in settings. If you press "F7", this will use the arguments you specify for the program. You can also debug by pressing "F5". Or you can use the status bar/menu items.

If you want to register gcc/g++ path manually, you can set it under settings. You can also set to save file before compiling.
