CHRT(1)                                            User Commands                                            CHRT(1)

NAME
       chrt - manipulate the real-time attributes of a process

SYNOPSIS
       chrt [options] priority command [argument...]
       chrt [options] -p [priority] pid

DESCRIPTION
       chrt  sets  or  retrieves  the  real-time scheduling attributes of an existing pid, or runs command with the
       given attributes.

POLICIES
       -o, --other
              Set scheduling policy to SCHED_OTHER.  This is the default Linux scheduling policy.

       -f, --fifo
              Set scheduling policy to SCHED_FIFO.

       -r, --rr
              Set scheduling policy to SCHED_RR.  When no policy is defined, the SCHED_RR is used as the default.

       -b, --batch
              Set scheduling policy to SCHED_BATCH (Linux-specific, supported since 2.6.16).  The priority argument
              has to be set to zero.

       -i, --idle
              Set  scheduling policy to SCHED_IDLE (Linux-specific, supported since 2.6.23).  The priority argument
              has to be set to zero.

       -d, --deadline
              Set scheduling policy to SCHED_DEADLINE (Linux-specific, supported since 3.14).  The  priority  argu‐
              ment  has  to  be  set  to zero.  See also --sched-runtime, --sched-deadline and --sched-period.  The
              relation between the options required by the kernel is runtime <= deadline <=  period.   chrt  copies
              period to deadline if --sched-deadline is not specified and deadline to runtime if --sched-runtime is
              not specified.  It means that at least --sched-period has to be specified.   See  sched(7)  for  more
              details.

SCHEDULING OPTIONS
       -T, --sched-runtime nanoseconds
              Specifies runtime parameter for SCHED_DEADLINE policy (Linux-specific).

       -P, --sched-period nanoseconds
              Specifies period parameter for SCHED_DEADLINE policy (Linux-specific).

       -D, --sched-deadline nanoseconds
              Specifies deadline parameter for SCHED_DEADLINE policy (Linux-specific).

       -R, --reset-on-fork
              Use SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK or SCHED_FLAG_RESET_ON_FORK flag.  Linux-specific, supported since 2.6.31.

              Each  thread has a reset-on-fork scheduling flag.  When this flag is set, children created by fork(2)
              do not inherit privileged scheduling policies.  After the reset-on-fork flag has been enabled, it can
              be  reset  only  if  the thread has the CAP_SYS_NICE capability.  This flag is disabled in child pro‐
              cesses created by fork(2).

              More precisely, if the reset-on-fork flag is set, the following rules apply for subsequently  created
              children:

              *  If  the  calling  thread has a scheduling policy of SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the policy is reset to
                 SCHED_OTHER in child processes.

              *  If the calling process has a negative nice value, the nice value is reset to zero  in  child  pro‐
                 cesses.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all-tasks
              Set or retrieve the scheduling attributes of all the tasks (threads) for a given PID.

       -m, --max
              Show minimum and maximum valid priorities, then exit.

       -p, --pid
              Operate on an existing PID and do not launch a new task.

       -v, --verbose
              Show status information.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

USAGE
       The default behavior is to run a new command:
              chrt priority command [arguments]

       You can also retrieve the real-time attributes of an existing task:
              chrt -p pid

       Or set them:
              chrt -r -p priority pid

PERMISSIONS
       A  user  must  possess CAP_SYS_NICE to change the scheduling attributes of a process.  Any user can retrieve
       the scheduling information.

NOTES
       Only SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_RR are part of POSIX 1003.1b Process Scheduling.  The other  schedul‐
       ing attributes may be ignored on some systems.

       Linux' default scheduling policy is SCHED_OTHER.
