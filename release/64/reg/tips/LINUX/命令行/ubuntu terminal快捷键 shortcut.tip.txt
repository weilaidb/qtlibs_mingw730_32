Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are combinations of keys that allow you to perform actions, such as opening the settings dialog or accessing a feature inside Terminal quickly. These shortcuts can be modified to suit your preferences.
To change a keyboard shortcut:
Press the menu button in the top-right corner of the window and select Preferences.
In the sidebar, select Shortcuts.
Make sure Enable shortcuts is selected.
Select the shortcut that you wish to edit by clicking on it.
Once the shortcut is selected, click on the shortcut key combination to edit it.
Press your desired shortcut key combination as you would enter it to use it. The keys that you can use include Alt, Alt Gr, Ctrl, Shift, Super, number and letter keys.
Mnemonic key combinations, such as Alt+F will not work.
Once you have entered your new shortcut, it will automatically be saved and you should see it in the list next to the corresponding action.
To disable a shortcut, edit it and press the Backspace instead of the new shortcut.
